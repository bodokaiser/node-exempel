# exempel

Lean [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) like Model and Collection for
browserify.

Benefits:
- easy integration into you View, Router stack
- easy integration to your persistence flow (just listen to "change")
- small code base (at least when you let uglifify clean up lodash)

## Installation

Install with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install --save exempel

## Preview

The basic idea is to have an extendable prototype which carries state
you can share between different views. The reason why I did not use any
existing library for this is that other libraries have a complete
different model approach (e.g. scheme based) or are just too heavy.

### Model

The `Model` prototype represents a single entity.

```
var util    = require('util');
var exempel = require('exempel');

function Product(source) {
  exempel.Model.call(this, source);

  this.isInternal = 'property';
  this.attributes.isA = 'real model property';

  listenToChangeEvent(this);
}

util.inherits(Product, exempel.Model);

Product.prototype.addComment = function(comment) {
  this.get('comments').push(comment);

  return this;
};

// will cache this model on change
// into the browsers session storage
function listenToChangeEvent(model) {
  model.on('change', function(key, value) {
    var source = JSON.stringify(model);

    sessionStorage.setItem('product', source);
  });
}
```

#### new Model([source])

Sets up a new `Model` instance with `source` as attributes. Will also
generate a unique id on `model.id`. The `Model` itself inherits from
`events.EventEmitter`.

#### Event: "change"

Emitted when you change a model attribute with `set()`. However as
`Object.observe` is still experimental there is currently no way to
observe properties without using a setter.

#### Event: "change:<key>"

Each time you set a property next to the "change" event there will be
another event "change:<key>" where "<key>" will be the property name.
This is useful if you want to listen to the change of a specific
property.

#### Event: "remove"

Emitted when you call `model.remove()`. This is actually for use with a
`collection` so we know when to remove a model from array.

#### model.has(key)

Returns `true` if model has property `key`.

#### model.get(key)

Returns value behind property `key`.

#### model.set(source)

Merges `source` onto `model.attributes`.

#### model.set(key, value)

Sets `value` on `model.attributes[key]`.

#### model.remove()

Will emit an "remove" event for listening collections.

#### model.toJSON()

Returns deep clone of `model.attributes`.

### Collection

The `Collection` prototype represents a collection of entities.

```
var util    = require('util');
var ldoash  = require('lodash');
var exempel = require('exempel');

function Products(source) {
  // if you do not specify Model it will use
  // the default Model
  this.Model = Product;

  exempel.Collection.call(this, source);
}

util.inherits(Products, exempel.Collection);

Products.prototype.find = function(query) {
  return lodash.find(this.models, {
    attributes: query
  });
};
```

#### new Collection([source])

Creates a new instance of `Collection` with pushing all items in
`source` to `collection.models`. Also inherits from
`events.EventEmitter`.

#### Event: "push"

Emitted when a model is added to collection. Will also be emitted by
`new Collection()` when mapping source.

```
collection.on('push', function(model) {
  // add model to list element
}};
collection.push(model);
```

#### Event: "remove"

Emitted when a model is removed from collection.

```
collection.on('remove', function(model) {
  // remove model from list element
  // note that it is wiser to just let the view
  // instance listen on the models "remove" event
  // then you do not have to query the right li from list view
}};
collection.remove(model);
```

#### Event: "change"

Emitted on when collection changes by "push" or "remove". Can be used if
you want to do a `PUT` on change. For example:

```
collection.on('change', function() {
  superagent.put('/comments/blabla')
    .send(collection)
    .end();
});
```

Also "change" will be emitted when a model in the collection changes.

#### collection.length

Shortcut to `collection.models.length`.

#### collection.at(index)

Returns model beeing at index of `collection.models`.

#### collection.has(uniqueid)

Returns `true` if model with `uniqueid` is inside `collection.models`.

#### collection.get(uniqueid)

Returns model with `uniqueid` from `collection.models`.

#### collection.push(model)

Adds model to collection. Note that `model` should be an instance of
`EventEmitter` else you will get an error as the collection binds to the
models "remove" event.

#### collection.remove(model)

Removes the model from collection.

#### collection.forEach(callback)

Shortcut for `collection.models.forEach`.

#### collection.toJSON()

Returns clone of `collection.models` with `toJSON` called on each model.
